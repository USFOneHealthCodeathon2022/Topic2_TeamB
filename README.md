Rapid extraction of genomic data from these diseases 

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

It is very hard to find data for various rare and neglected diseases because the information is scattered across different databases. These databases included The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We are building a tool that facilitates searching and downloading of genomic data across these databases. This software, RDGREx: Rare Disease Genome Data Extractor, is a user-friendly tool for quickly and concisely extracting genomic data.

<b> Rare and Neglected Diseases </b>
The current version of the RDGREx contains data on the following diseases:
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Acute promyelocytic leukemia
Adrenocortical carcinoma
Beta thalassemia
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Friedreich ataxia
Glioblastoma
Hodgkin lymphoma
Huntington's disease
Klienefelter Syndrome
Leigh Syndrome
Mantle cell pymphoma
Multiple myeloma
Pituitary Cancer
Prader-Willi syndrome
Retinoblastoma
Sjogren's syndrome
Small cell lung cancer
Spinal muscular atrophy
Turner Syndrome
Williams syndrome
Xeroderma pigmentosum
