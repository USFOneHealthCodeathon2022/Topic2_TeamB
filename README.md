Rapid extraction of genomic data from these diseases 

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

It is very hard to find data for various rare and neglected diseases because the information is scattered across different databases. These databases include The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Sequence Read Archive (SRA), Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We are building a tool that facilitates searching and downloading of genomic data across these databases. This software, RDGREx: Rare Disease Genome Data Extractor, is a user-friendly tool for quickly and concisely extracting genomic data.

<b> Rare and Neglected Diseases </b>
The current version of the RDGREx contains data on the following diseases:

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

Acute promyelocytic leukemia

Adrenocortical carcinoma

Beta thalassemia

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

Friedreich ataxia

Glioblastoma

Hodgkin lymphoma

Huntington's disease

Klienefelter Syndrome

Leigh Syndrome

Mantle cell pymphoma

Multiple myeloma

Pituitary Cancer

Prader-Willi syndrome

Retinoblastoma

Sjogren's syndrome

Small cell lung cancer

Spinal muscular atrophy

Turner Syndrome

Williams syndrome

Xeroderma pigmentosum

Once a disease has been selected, the desired data can be downloaded and used.
